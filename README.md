> Do you hate writing resumes and cover letters? Do you wish you could just tell the companies to give you money already?
> Meet ResumeDoc, your new best friend. Just tell him who you are and what job you want, and he'll whip up the perfect documents for you in no time.
> And that's not all. He can also handle those annoying questions that some startups ask, like why you love their company or what makes you unique.
> Don't say "I don't want to be homeless". Let ResumeDoc say something smart and original for you!

## ❓ Why?
> Because you need money, and these tech companies won't give it to you unless you make them feel special.
> They use automated systems to filter out your applications, so why should you waste time reading their job descriptions?
> ResumeDoc automates the whole process of creating custom resumes and cover letters for every job.
> It's a numbers game, and the faster you apply, the less likely you'll get evicted.
> ResumeDoc is still in development, but I'm working hard to improve it. 
> It works on linux, but I'll soon get it working via docker on any system you could want, 
> Email me if you need help.
